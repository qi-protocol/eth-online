About You:
Charles Taylor brings over a decade of software engineering experience to the table, including seven-plus years in the crypto space. His journey began in grade school, with a natural aptitude for programming, leading to early contract software engineering work during high school. He holds a BSEE with a specialization in control systems from CSULB.

Throughout his career, Charles has worked on a range of projects, from control flow to crypto, where he established himself as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) expert. After a nine-month tenure in the crypto industry post-2022 market shifts, he founded Splice and connected with his co-founder at ETH Denver 2023, kickstarting their journey to create Qi Protocol. Charles's extensive software engineering experience and deep crypto expertise make him a valuable candidate for support from your accelerator or funding program, with the potential to drive Qi Protocol's success in the crypto landscape.
